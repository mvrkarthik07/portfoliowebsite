    title:'G-SHOCK: Stress Test',

    title:'Tame Impala: Colorful Chaos',
    description:
      'This poster interprets Tame Impala through typographic motion rather than literal imagery. Letterforms are stretched, curved, and fragmented to echo the fluid, psychedelic quality of the music—where rhythm feels elastic and time appears distorted. The subdued palette and soft glow emphasize atmosphere over clarity, allowing type to function as an expressive medium rather than a static carrier of text. The work explores how sound can be translated into form through movement, repetition, and controlled abstraction.',

    image: '/Images/Posters/jellyfish.png',
    title:'Specter.',
    description:
      'This poster studies the jellyfish as a form that exists between presence and absence. Rendered in stark monochrome and suspended within negative space, the subject is treated less as a biological specimen and more as a fleeting apparition. The fragmented textures and drifting composition emphasize unfamiliarity, scale, and isolation—echoing the way deep-sea life is perceived: distant, elusive, and only briefly revealed. The work explores how minimalism and contrast can transform natural forms into symbols of ambiguity and quiet tension.',
